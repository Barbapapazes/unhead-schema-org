title: Treeshake Plugin
description: Remove composables from your client builds.
---

Without a plugin, server tags are ignored with a simple runtime check. This isn't ideal as you'll still be bundling the
server code to the client.

To allow the server composables to be tree-shaken, getting an extra performance boost, you can install treeshake plugin.

This is entirely optional and may not be needed for your use case. Setting it up can be a little tricky.

```bash
yarn add @unhead/addons
```

Then, add the plugin to your build config.

#### Vite

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import UnheadVite from '@unhead/addons/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    UnheadVite(),
  ],
})
```

#### Webpack

```ts
// webpack.config.ts
import { UnheadWebpack } from '@unhead/addons/webpack'

export default {
  plugins: [
    UnheadWebpack(),
  ],
}
```
