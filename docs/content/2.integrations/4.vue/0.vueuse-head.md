description: "Should you use @vueuse/head or @unhead/vue"

Version 1 of `@vueuse/head` is a simpler wrapper around `@unhead/vue`. 

Using `@vueuse/head` over `@unhead/vue` is perfectly fine, you still get all of the unhead features.

## Differences

### `@unhead/vue` does not ship a component API

If you need `<Head>`, use `@vueuse/head`

### `@unhead/vue` does not bundle the SSR

If you use `@unhead/vue` you'll need to also import `@unhead/ssr`.
